# Title
Statements With No Effects

## Relationships
[CWE-561: Dead Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/561.html)

## Description
In Solidity, it's possible to write statements that have no side effects. Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for side-effect-free statements. This can lead to statements going unnoticed, causing a function to proceed without properly performing an intended action.

For example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)("");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).

## Remediation
It's important to carefully ensure that your contract does not contain any side-effect-free statements.
